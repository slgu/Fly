SAST:
3. network code generated needed (to be done) MOST IMPORTANT TO design!!!
7. global variable added (to be done) (maybe easy)
8. set map list comprehen (to be done) (Third important)
9. class design (Second important)
    member function call member function

CODEGEN:

cp1.We are implicit typing like C++ template.
    Unlike ocaml type variable
cp2.when set None variable, we need class modification
    like A::null.
    (Rule: type needs to be decided when first access to it*)
cp3.
    (Small optimization)
